# Introduction 

This is a collection of machine learning usecases, often requested by customers. 

These analytics use-cases can easily be applied to verticals other than retail and marketing. For example, the Churn analytics use-case can be utilized for numerous organizations belonging to any industry vertical. The idea is to present a generic hands-on use-case along with some sample open-sourced datasets so that a developer can understand the different steps that are involved in the machine learning exploration and development of such a use case.
